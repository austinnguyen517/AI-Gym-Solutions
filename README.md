  - Takeaways from each problem

DQN: Using network to find Q values (off policy) associated with state action pairs. Simple implementation using experience replay and random sampling.

SARSA: Network to find Q values using on policy version of DQN. Uses experience replay, random sampling, and rewards entire successful episodes

Coming: REINFORCE algorithm to solve continuous version of mountain car by having network return probablistic distribution of values
